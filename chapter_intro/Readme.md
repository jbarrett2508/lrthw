Questions:
> What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

Reading and writing, attention to detail, and spotting differences.

> Please explain these three skills in your own words.

Being able to type well is important because it leads to more efficient coding and builds familiarity with code symbols and syntax. This in turn helps a programmer read the language once it's been typed out.
Paying attention to little details is crucial to getting a program to work. It helps create better programs because the coder is more aware of the things that make a code effective.
Typing in code samples and comparing them to what's asked for will help a programmer identify any differences between the two and thereby spot the mistakes in the code.

> Why do you need to not copy and paste?

Copying and pasting is a shortcut that robs a beginning programmer of the process of learning to manually key in code. Learning to do so will equip a beginner with the ability to read, write, and see code.
