Add your research (on math and numbers with floats/integers) to Readme.rb:

> Float objects represent inexact real numbers using the native architecture's double-precision floating point representation.
Floating point has a different arithmetic and is an inexact number.

> The integer class is the basis for the two concrete classes that hold whole numbers, Bignum and Fixnum.

> The Fixnum and Bignum classes represent integers of differing sizes. Both classes descend from Integer (and therefore Numeric). The floating-point numbers are objects of class Float, corresponding to the native architecture's double data type. The Complex, BigDecimal, and Rational classes are not built-in to Ruby but are distributed with Ruby as part of the standard library.

> In Ruby, numbers without decimal points are called integers, and numbers with decimal points are usually called floating-point numbers or, more simply, floats (you must place at least one digit before the decimal point). An integer literal is simply a sequence of digits eg. 0, 123, 123456789. Underscores may be inserted into integer literals (though not at the beginning or end), and this feature is sometimes used as a thousands separator eg. 1_000_000_000. Underscore characters are ignored in the digit string.
