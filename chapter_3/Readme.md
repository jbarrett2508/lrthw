Add your research (on math and numbers with floats/integers) to Readme.rb:


> In Ruby, numbers without decimal points (i.e. whole numbers) are called integers, and numbers with decimal points are usually called floating-point numbers or, more simply, floats. At least one digit must be placed before the decimal point in a floating-point number. When performing arithmetic, if either side of a floating-point operation is a float, the operation will use floating-point math (and return a float as a result). Performing division on an integer will not return a remainder, only an integer rounded up or down to the nearest whole number as the situation dictates.
